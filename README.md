This repo serves to explore the concepts contained in the paper [*Conv-TasNet: Surpassing Ideal Time-Frequency
Magnitude Masking for Speech Separation*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07454.pdf).

The authors of the paper provided PyTorch code as an [example implementation](https://github.com/naplab/Conv-TasNet/tree/e66d82a8f956a69749ec8a4ae382217faa097c5c). Additionally, there exists an official [PyTorch implementation](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/_modules/torchaudio/models/conv_tasnet.html); the official implementation was used as a guide for the TensorFlow code contained in this repo.

      " |    layer to the input tensors (which should be passed in as argument).\n",
      " |    Two reserved keyword arguments you can optionally use in `call()` are:\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  There are two ways to instantiate a `Model`:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  1 - With the \"Functional API\", where you start from `Input`,\n",
      " |  you chain layer calls to specify the model's forward pass,\n",
      " |  and finally you create your model from inputs and outputs:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ```python\n",
      " |  import tensorflow as tf\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(3,))\n",
      " |  x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation=tf.nn.relu)(inputs)\n",

      " |  model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)\n",
      " |  ```\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Note: Only dicts, lists, and tuples of input tensors are supported. Nested\n",
      " |  inputs are not supported (e.g. lists of list or dicts of dict).\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  A new Functional API model can also be created by using the\n",
      " |  intermediate tensors. This enables you to quickly extract sub-components\n",
      " |  of the model.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Example:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ```python\n",
      " |  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(None, None, 3))\n",
      " |  processed = keras.layers.RandomCrop(width=32, height=32)(inputs)\n",
      " |  conv = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=2, kernel_size=3)(processed)\n",
      " |  pooling = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(conv)\n",
      " |  feature = keras.layers.Dense(10)(pooling)\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  full_model = keras.Model(inputs, feature)\n",
      " |  backbone = keras.Model(processed, conv)\n",
      " |  activations = keras.Model(conv, feature)\n",
      " |  ```\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Note that the `backbone` and `activations` models are not\n",
      " |  created with `keras.Input` objects, but with the tensors that are originated\n",
      " |  from `keras.Inputs` objects. Under the hood, the layers and weights will\n",
      " |  be shared across these models, so that user can train the `full_model`, and\n",
      " |  use `backbone` or `activations` to do feature extraction.\n",
      " |  The inputs and outputs of the model can be nested structures of tensors as\n",
      " |  well, and the created models are standard Functional API models that support\n",
      " |  all the existing APIs.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  2 - By subclassing the `Model` class: in that case, you should define your\n",
      " |  layers in `__init__()` and you should implement the model's forward pass\n",
      " |  in `call()`.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ```python\n",
      " |  import tensorflow as tf\n",
